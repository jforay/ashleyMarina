                <p>Annual Regime Assessments for The Harborage at Ashley Marina Condominium Association are split into quarterly payments that are due on these dates:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>January 1</li>
                    <li>April 1</li>
                    <li>July 1</li>
                    <li>October 1</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Payments are due on or before the 1st day of the Quarter and will be assessed a late fee if payment is not received within 30 days of the due date and will be applied to each subsequent month thereafter. The Late Fee will be calculated based on any outstanding amount due which will be assessed at 1.5% (per month) with a minimum charge of $25.00. Regime accounts that are ≥ 90 days past due will be sent to collections and legal fees passed through to the account.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Administrative Fee Upon Sale or Transfer:</strong> Effective 2/23/24, an administrative fee of $450 along with an initiation fee, effective 9/1/2024, shall be charged to anyone purchasing a slip and shall be paid to the Association at closing. The administration fee recognizes the substantial time, efforts and resources devoted to initial conversations with marina staff during the inquiry stages (prior to purchase), responding to legal firms for buyers, marina introductions, review of Rules and Regulations, parking pass (returns and issuing of new pass), insurance review and documentation, updating contact information for slip owners, and QuickBooks/accounting modifications. The new owner initiation fee is established at $25/foot (effective Sept 1, 2024), in addition to the existing $450 administrative fee.</p>
                
                <p>The initiation fee calculation is as follows: for example, a fifty-five foot slip transfer will have an initiation fee of $1,375.00, plus the administrative fee of $450.00 for a total of $1,825.00.</p>
                
                <p>Contact information must be updated regularly with the Association Manager. All invoices are now sent electronically via email and must be paid by bank account (1% fee) or credit card (3% fee).</p>
